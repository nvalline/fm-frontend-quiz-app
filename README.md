## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript
- Semantic HTML
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project I learned and implemented Typescript and a Dark/Light mode. This was the first time using Typescript in an application and I feel like I adopted it pretty quickly. The Dark/Light mode was also a first for me to use in an application. I chose to control this with dynamic classes that apply the different styles.

### Continued development

I am excited to continue to use Typescript as I feel it is a neccesity with modern development practices. I also plan on continuing to challenge and grow on all my frontend skills to be a better developer.

### Useful resources

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - This also provides great documentation for implementing typescript into your applciations.
